# ParticleSim
Particle simulator using pygame I made back in 2014

Designed for an Alevel project, this small simple simulator simulates particles in an enclosed system reacting and combining using simple physics and chemistry theories such as coefficient of restitution and activation energy.

The app gives the user options to add any number of particles and set the general activation energy require for particles to react in the system as well as changing the temperature or pressure of the system in Realtime.
